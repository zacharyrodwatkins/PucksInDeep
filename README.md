# Pucks In Deep (a.k.a RZA)

We were tasked by the UBC Engineering Physics Project Lab to develop a platform for a next generation AI and Automation course. Over the last two years we have designed and built an automated air hockey table for which students are able to implement their own agents to compete against human opponents.

Robotic zippin’ air hockey - RZA - is an H-Bot gantry system capable of playing air hockey with human-like performance. We have designed a plug-and-play interface which separates the control into two distinct sections: high level control, and low level control. The high level control is responsible for choosing paths for the mallet to follow based on the current state of the game. The low level control is responsible for executing the chosen paths to high accuracy. This interface allows AI development students to not worry about the details of moving the gantry while developing their high level decision making systems.

The RZA allows students test and compare their respective agents on a real physical system. This will lead to an exciting final evaluation for students in this AI course as the performance of their decision making system is judged in a 1v1 competition format.

With a rudimentary high level decision making system, the RZA can play a human in air hockey. It can comfortably defend its net, and can score the occasional goal.
